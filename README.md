# IbM
Individual based model on bacterial colonies

Mathemathical model simulating the diffusion of compounds and bacterial growth.

>> To execute the model:
	1. Call 'loadModelXlsx' function to load and create the model structure and parameters. A struct named R will be created in your Workspace.
	2. Save R struct as R.mat.
	3. Execute the model with 'call' function
	4. To represent the results, run 'draw' function
